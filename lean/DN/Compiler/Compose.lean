Adapted from the compiler extraction recorded in docs/provenance.json.
These definitions and theorems concern the Lean model. Correspondence to the
HOL4 backend, pretty-printer/parser, ABI and executable is tracked separately
in docs/assurance.md. The model is a restricted 64-bit Pancake fragment.

/-! ## 0. The operational-refinement predicate

`Refines o p φ`: the emitted program `p` refines the state-transformer `φ`.
"Refines" = runs to a NORMAL termination (`result = none`, i.e. no error /
timeout / early return / FFI-final) in the model semantics, landing in EXACTLY
`φ s`, and leaves the clock untouched. Clock-preservation is what makes the
`fix_clock` clamp at every `Seq` boundary a no-op, so refinements compose
cleanly. -/
def Refines (o : Oracle σ) (p : PancakeProg) (φ : PancakeState σ → PancakeState σ) : Prop :=
  ∀ s : PancakeState σ, PancakeSem o p s = (none, φ s) ∧ (φ s).clock = s.clock

/-! ## 1. Primitive stage-kinds

Note on the `fix_clock` clamps: structure eta makes `{ t with clock := t.clock }`
DEFINITIONALLY equal to `t`, so once a refinement pins `(φ s).clock = s.clock`
the `min`-clamp collapses and the clamped state is `defeq` to the unclamped one
(closed by `exact`, no rewrite needed). -/

/-- SKIP is the identity stage. -/
theorem refines_skip (o : Oracle σ) : Refines o .skip (fun s => s) := by
  intro s; refine ⟨?_, rfl⟩; rw [PancakeSem]

/-- ASSIGN (the transform/set stage): given the RHS evaluates (in every state)
to `f s`, the emitted `Assign` refines the local-update transformer. Genuinely
computes `f`: `f` is threaded through the model `eval`. -/
theorem refines_assign (o : Oracle σ) (x : String) (e : PancakeExp)

  intro s
  exact ⟨sem_assign (oracle := o) (hf s), rfl⟩

/-- STORE (the memory-write stage): given the address and value evaluate and the
address is in the model's address set, the emitted `Store` refines the
single-word memory update. -/
theorem refines_store (o : Oracle σ) (dst src : PancakeExp)

/-! ## 2. SEQUENTIAL COMPOSITION — the key compositional lemma -/

/-- SEQ: sequential composition of two refinements refines the composed
transformer. The `fix_clock` clamp at the `Seq` boundary is discharged by
clock-preservation (`state_setClock_self`). This is THE compositional win:
`emit (s1 ; s2)` refines `denote s2 ∘ denote s1`. -/

/-! ## 3. COND — the branch stage-kind -/

/-- `If`-reduction: `evaluate (If e c1 c2, s)` with `eval s e = some w` runs the
`w ≠ 0`-selected branch (panSem `If` clause). -/

  rw [PancakeSem, h]

/-- COND: a guarded branch. Given the guard expression evaluates to the SPEC's
boolean (`1` when the branch predicate `b` holds, `0` otherwise), the emitted
`If` refines the branch-selecting transformer. Both arms must be refinements. -/

/-! ## 4. DEC — lexical-scope wrapper

`Dec v e cont` binds `v` to `eval e`, runs the continuation, then RESTORES the
shadowed binding (`res_var`). Its transformer is the continuation's transformer
sandwiched between the bind and the restore. Reuses the pilot's `sem_dec`. -/

/-! ## 5. The GENERIC emit over the loop-free stage grammar

A `Stage` is a syntax tree of the composable stage-kinds. Each primitive leaf
carries BOTH its emitted program and its intended denotation; `WF` collects the
per-leaf refinement obligations (and per-branch guard obligations). The theorem
`emit_correct_generic` then discharges emit-correctness for the WHOLE tree by
structural induction, using the rules of §1–§4. This is the Gate-A shape for the
loop-free fragment: no new per-stage proof is needed once the leaves are
discharged. -/

/-- A verified primitive leaf: its emitted program `prog` with the
state-transformer `den` it is meant to compute. -/
structure Prim (σ : Type) where
  prog : PancakeProg
  den  : PancakeState σ → PancakeState σ

inductive Stage (σ : Type)
  | prim (p : Prim σ)
  | seq  (s1 s2 : Stage σ)
  | cond (e : PancakeExp) (guard : PancakeState σ → Bool) (s1 s2 : Stage σ)

/-- The structural emitter: `Stage` syntax → `PancakeProg`. -/
def emit : Stage σ → PancakeProg
  | .prim p          => p.prog
  | .seq s1 s2       => .seq (emit s1) (emit s2)
  | .cond e _ s1 s2  => .cond e (emit s1) (emit s2)

/-- The denotation: `Stage` syntax → state-transformer. `seq` composes, `cond`
selects on the guard. This is the SPEC the emitted program must refine. -/
def denote : Stage σ → (PancakeState σ → PancakeState σ)
  | .prim p          => p.den
  | .seq s1 s2       => fun s => denote s2 (denote s1 s)
  | .cond _ g s1 s2  => fun s => if g s then denote s1 s else denote s2 s

/-- Well-formedness = the collected leaf/branch obligations. A `prim` leaf must
actually refine its declared denotation; a `cond` guard must evaluate to the
declared boolean. These are precisely the per-stage facts discharged in §1–§4. -/
def WF (o : Oracle σ) : Stage σ → Prop
  | .prim p          => Refines o p.prog p.den

                          ∧ WF o s1 ∧ WF o s2

/-- GENERIC EMIT-CORRECTNESS: a well-formed stage's emitted program refines its
denotation. Structural induction closing each node by the §1–§4 composition
rules. Any serve assembled from `{prim, seq, cond}` stage-kinds is emit-correct
by this single theorem — the loop-free Gate-A. -/

  | .prim _, hwf => hwf

      exact refines_seq o (emit_correct_generic o s1 w1) (emit_correct_generic o s2 w2)

/-! ### Inherited two-stage demonstration (quarantined contract)

A concrete serve of two stage-kinds — a memory-write STORE followed by an
ASSIGN publishing a result word — assembled as a `Stage`, shown well-formed from
the §1 primitive lemmas, and thus emit-correct by `emit_correct_generic` under
its stated hypotheses. Those hypotheses quantify a bound local and memory-domain
membership over *every* `PancakeState` and are contradictory (instantiate states
with an empty locals map or empty memory domain). Therefore this theorem is an
inherited API-shape demonstration, not an applicable or non-vacuous certificate.
See `DN.Compiler.AssuranceChecks` and `docs/reviews/compiler-assurance.md`. -/

def demoStore (w : Word) : Prim σ :=

    den  := fun s =>
      { s with memory := fun k =>

/-! ## 6. The bounded-LOOP stage-kind — reusable While rule + the honest gap

The loop stage-kind does NOT fit the uniform `Refines` grammar above: a `While`
computes a total state-transformer only relative to a loop INVARIANT and a
clock/iteration budget (unbounded input diverges past the clock → `Timeout`, not
a `none`-normal `φ s`). So a generic loop stage needs an invariant + a decreasing
measure SUPPLIED per loop — it is not closed under the parameter-free `Refines`.

The region pilot's `scan_loop` is the concrete instance (invariant = the
accumulator relation, measure = remaining iterations `rem`, budgeted by the
clock). Below is that instance's shape lifted to a REUSABLE Hoare-style rule: a
`While` whose body advances an invariant `I : Nat → State → Prop` (indexed by
remaining iterations) and preserves the clock refines to the invariant's
`0`-index state, given the guard tracks the index and the body is a refinement at
each step. A generic loop STAGE would embed this, paying the per-loop `I`/measure
as extra `WF` data (the named Gate-A distance for loops). -/

/-- Reusable bounded-`While` rule. `I n` is the loop invariant with `n`
iterations of budget remaining; `bodyφ` the one-iteration body transformer.
Hypotheses: the guard evaluates to `0` iff `n = 0` (loop stops exactly when the
index is exhausted); the body is a clock-preserving refinement to `bodyφ` that
steps `I (n+1) s → I n (bodyφ (decClock s))`. Conclusion: from `I rem s` with
`rem ≤ s.clock`, the loop runs to a state satisfying `I 0`. Generalises
`scan_loop`. -/
