/-! ## 1. The reusable CONDITIONAL bounded-`While` rule

`I n s` is the loop invariant with `n` iterations of budget remaining. Unlike
`while_inv`, the body obligation `hbody` is GUARDED by `I (n+1) s`: the body must
compute to a normal state that (a) satisfies `I n`, and (b) has consumed exactly
one tick of clock — but ONLY from states already in the invariant. This is what
lets a memory- or local-reading body (the scan) be a loop instance. Conclusion:
`I rem s` with `rem ≤ s.clock`, the emitted `While` runs to a state satisfying
`I 0`. Generalises `while_inv` (whose unconditional `hbody`/`hstep` give this one)
and `scan_loop`. -/

/-! ## 2. The SCAN `While` as a loop instance of `while_inv_cond`

The invariant carries the rolling-digest accumulator relation, the index, the
frame locals, and the `ViewBytes` byte-memory relation (the load_vec FFI
postcondition A0, an EXPLICIT hypothesis — never a `sorry`). `n` = the number of
iterations still to run; the current index is `k = len - n` (threaded as an
existential `k` with `k + n = len`). -/

/-! ## 3. Tie to the `emit` translator

The certified loop is exactly what the structural translator emits: `scanBody` is
`emit scanBodyStage` for a `Stage` assembled from two primitive-leaf `assign`s, so
`.while_ guard (emit scanBodyStage)` is `scanWhile` definitionally. The primitive
leaves' `den` fields are irrelevant to the loop certificate (the loop's semantic
contract is carried by `scanInv`, not by an unconditional `Refines`), so they are
set to the identity placeholder — the point is that the EMITTED PROGRAM the
translator produces for the body is the one the loop rule certifies. -/

/-- The scan body's two leaf programs, named so the `Stage` leaves' field values
are simple identifiers. Definitionally the two `Assign`s of `scanBody`. -/
