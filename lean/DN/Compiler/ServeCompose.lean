/-! ## 2. `seqAll` + THE COMPOSITION LAW (list induction)

The whole point: an N-stage pipeline is ONE `seq`-composed term, and its denotation is
the left fold of the per-stage steps — by induction on the list, once, for every N. -/

/-! ### 2.1 Halt-freedom — the stamps never short-circuit

The response-phase stage terms contain no `gate`, so the fold stays live through the
whole onion. That is the side condition the composition theorem carries, and it is
decided structurally. -/

One `∀`-quantified theorem per deployed stage SHAPE. Every deployed stage of a shape
is an instantiation — a list entry, not a proof. -/

/-! ### 3.1 Shape A — the header-stamp chain

The deployed stamp shape appends its rendered header set onto the affine builder
(`hs.foldl addHeader b`, one in-place push per header). `stampChain` is its term. -/

/-! ### 3.2 Shape B — the refusal-gate chain (first fire wins)

The deployed request phase runs the gates in list order and the FIRST `.respond` wins:
the handler and every LATER gate are skipped. `gateChain` is its term, and `firstFire`
is that decision as a function. -/

/-- **The gate chain** — one `gate` per refusal, composed in deployed list order. -/

short-circuits to the FIRST firing gate's status and halts; if none fires it is the
identity — for ANY (predicate, status) list, by LIST INDUCTION. The absorbing law
(`denoteStep_halted`) is what makes a later gate unable to overwrite an earlier one's
status: first fire wins, exactly as the deployed request phase decides. Every
gate-shaped deployed stage is this theorem at its own predicate and status. -/

/-! ## 4. The deployed pipeline model — TRANSCRIBED

The deployed serve is built in a different package that this one does not (and, for
the translator's independence, should not) import. Its pipeline model is therefore
transcribed here definition for definition — the affine response builder, the two-phase
`Stage`, the reverse-order response fold, and the gating pipeline fold. Nothing here is
a re-specification from prose: each definition mirrors its deployed counterpart, and
the deployed context's extra fields (raw input bytes, the attribute bag) are the ones
the stage predicates below are pre-decided over. -/

/-- The affine response builder — one accumulating cell, mutated in place. -/
structure DBuilder where
  /-- The accumulating response — the single reused cell. -/
  acc : Response

/-- Acquire the cell, seeded with the handler's response. -/
def DBuilder.ofResponse (r : Response) : DBuilder := ⟨r⟩

/-- Finalize the builder to the wire response. -/
def DBuilder.build (b : DBuilder) : Response := b.acc

/-- Append a header in place — the deployed `addHeader` (`headers ++ [nv]`). -/
def DBuilder.addHeader (b : DBuilder) (nv : Bytes × Bytes) : DBuilder :=
  ⟨{ b.acc with headers := b.acc.headers ++ [nv] }⟩

/-- Map a transform over the accumulated response. -/
def DBuilder.mapResp (b : DBuilder) (f : Response → Response) : DBuilder := ⟨f b.acc⟩

/-- The request-phase decision: gate with a response, or pass through. -/
inductive DStageStep
  /-- Gate: answer now; the handler and every later stage's request phase are skipped. -/
  | respond (r : Response)
  /-- Pass through to the next stage. -/
  | pass (c : Ctx)

/-- A deployed stage: a request phase (run in list order) and a response phase (run in
REVERSE list order — the onion). -/
structure DStage where
  /-- A human name (diagnostics; not load-bearing). -/
  name : String
  /-- Request phase, run in list order. -/
  onRequest : Ctx → DStageStep
  /-- Response phase, run in REVERSE list order, threading the affine builder. -/
  onResponse : Ctx → DBuilder → DBuilder

/-- **The response-only fold (the onion).** Thread the builder back outward: each
stage's `onResponse` in REVERSE list order (head = outermost, so it runs LAST). -/
def dRunResp : List DStage → Ctx → DBuilder → DBuilder
  | [], _, b => b
  | s :: rest, c, b => s.onResponse c (dRunResp rest c b)

/-- **The pipeline fold.** Run the request phase in list order; the first stage that
responds short-circuits (the handler and every later stage's REQUEST phase skipped,
while the remaining stages' response transforms still run over the refusal). If every
stage passes, seed the builder from the handler and thread it back outward. -/
def dRunPipeline : List DStage → (Ctx → Response) → Ctx → DBuilder
  | [], handler, c => DBuilder.ofResponse (handler c)
  | s :: rest, handler, c =>
    match s.onRequest c with
    | .respond r => dRunResp rest c (DBuilder.ofResponse r)
    | .pass c'   => s.onResponse c' (dRunPipeline rest handler c')

/-! ### 4.1 The shape stages — the deployed stage forms, transcribed

Each is the EXACT form the deployed stages of that shape take. The concrete pipeline
of §5 is built out of these. -/

/-- **The list-stamp shape** — `onResponse := fun _ b => hs.foldl addHeader b`: fold a
rendered header set onto the builder, unconditionally. (The deployed security-header
stage's exact form.) -/
def dStampList (nm : String) (hs : List (Bytes × Bytes)) : DStage where
  name := nm
  onRequest := fun c => .pass c
  onResponse := fun _ b => hs.foldl DBuilder.addHeader b

/-- **The conditional-stamp shape** — `onResponse := fun c b => if p c then b.addHeader nv else b`:
stamp one header when the stage's own condition holds, else pass the builder through. -/
def dCondStamp (nm : String) (p : ReqPred) (nv : Bytes × Bytes) : DStage where
  name := nm
  onRequest := fun c => .pass c
  onResponse := fun c b => if p c then b.addHeader nv else b

/-- **The refusal-gate shape** — `onRequest := fun c => if p c then .respond r else .pass c`
with an identity response phase: the deployed gates' exact form (their whole byte
effect is in the `.respond`). -/
def dGate (nm : String) (p : ReqPred) (r : Response) : DStage where
  name := nm
  onRequest := fun c => if p c then .respond r else .pass c
  onResponse := fun _ b => b

/-! ## 5. THE COMPOSITION THEOREM

`Realizes` is the per-stage obligation: the stage term's fold step reproduces the
deployed stage's response-phase builder transform. The composition theorem lifts N
realizations to the WHOLE fold by INDUCTION over the stage list. -/

/-- **`Realizes ctx s p`** — the stage term `p` reproduces the deployed stage `s`'s
response-phase transform at `ctx`, for ANY builder state it is threaded. -/

/-- **`Passes ctx s`** — the deployed stage's request phase passes at `ctx`. -/
def Passes (ctx : Ctx) (s : DStage) : Prop := s.onRequest ctx = .pass ctx

onion over the handler's response — by LIST INDUCTION, for any stage list. -/

onion equals the fold of the composed term `seqAll ps.reverse` — the whole N-stage
onion, by INDUCTION over the realization relation (`List.Forall₂`), not N hand steps.

The `reverse` is the onion: the head stage is outermost and its `onResponse` runs LAST,
so its term sits LAST in the composition. Gate-freedom keeps the fold live across the
whole onion, which is what lets each stage's realization (stated on a live state) apply
at its position. -/

`serveProg` is a `StageProg`, so the genuine per-constructor compiler's

constructor rather than as a stub. -/

reference fold of the WHOLE serve (`denoteStep ctx (serveProg g ps)`: the status, the
header count, the body length, and the halt flag of the response the deployed pipeline
builds, per the composition theorem). ONE line: `compile2_correct` at `p := serveProg …`.
No new induction, no per-stage case — the compiler's own structural induction covers the
52-way composition exactly as it covers a single `addHeader`. -/

/-! ### 7.2 THE COVERAGE — 25 of 52 composed; the other 27, each with its reason

COMPOSED (25):
* 20 gate-shaped, via `deployGates` (positions 1, 2, 4, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24,
  25, 28, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47) — the request-phase STATUS decision, first fire
  wins. Each status is the one its own deployed refusal response carries.
* 5 response-phase, via `deployRespProgs` (positions 6, 29, 33, 50, 52).

NOT COMPOSED (27), by reason — an honest list, not a forced fit:

(a) ACCUMULATOR-KEYED (4). The deployed condition reads `b.acc.status` MID-FOLD
    (`if b.acc.status == 200 && …`). `ReqPred := Ctx → Bool` sees the request and the
    handler's base only, never the accumulated response, so the condition is not a
    `ReqPred`. Positions 7 (last-modified stamp), 8 (asset expires), 9 (asset
    immutable), 34 (cache-status stamp keyed on the built status).
    NOTE: position 6 and position 29 are composed with this conjunct DROPPED — their
    terms gate on the static-asset bit only. That is the pre-existing scope of those
    lifts, restated here rather than papered over.

(b) HEADER-LIST-KEYED APPEND-UNLESS-PRESENT (7). The deployed form is
    `mapResp (fun r => { r with headers := stampX r.headers })` where `stampX` returns
    the list UNCHANGED if the field is already present. The decision reads the
    ACCUMULATED header list, which no `ReqPred` can see. Position 33 (`Via`) IS
    composed only because its term takes the has-field bit as a parameter and the
    surrounding onion adds no such field — the same dodge does not hold for the others
    once several append the same family. Positions 30 (alt-svc), 31 (permissions-
    policy), 32 (cross-origin-resource), 35 (warning transform), 36 (link preload,
    additionally status-keyed), 27 (timing-allow-origin), 38 (stale-while-revalidate).

(c) BODY TRANSFORMS (5). `rewriteBody` carries `identity`/`replace`/`append` only; these
    stages compute a NEW body from the old one (rendering, rewriting, encoding), which
    the bounded body-loop constructors cannot express as a closed term. Positions 3
    (error-page render — additionally status-keyed), 5 (range unveil), 13 (multi-range
    206), 51 (html rewrite), 49 (gzip — body transform AND a stamp).

(d) HEADER REWRITES (3). The deployed form MAPS over the existing headers
    (`headers.map hardenHeader`, `rewriteResp`) — a rewrite of what is there, not an
    append. `addHeader` only appends; there is no map-over-headers op. Positions 20
    (cookie hardening), 48 (header rewrite), 52 is composed (it appends) but position
    52's SIBLING rewrite at position 53 is not deployed. Positions 20, 48, and the
    final header stage (rewriteResp).

(e) CONTEXT-TRANSFORMING PASSES (3). The stage passes with a MUTATED context
    (`.continue (mfContinueCtx c)`, `.continue (unveilCtx c)`, the proxy preamble
    recovery) — the request-phase context threading `StageProg` has no op for (its
    `Ctx` is fixed across the fold). Positions 28's continue branch (only its refusal is
    composed), 5, 37 (proxy protocol).

(f) COMPOSITE / DELEGATING (5). Positions 10 (a route-conditional wrapper around
    another stage's response phase), 14 (language stamp — TWO conditional appends with a
    negotiated value), 15/21/22/26 (conditional stamps whose header VALUE is computed
    per-request, and position 44, a cache stage built by a config-driven constructor).
    These are conditional-stamp shaped and would compose via `realizes_dCondStamp` once
    their values are lifted; they are listed as NOT DONE because their values are not
    read here, and inventing them is exactly the failure mode this module refuses.

The counts are 4 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 5 = 27, plus the 25 composed = 52.

WHAT WOULD MOVE THE LINE MOST: (b) and (a) together are 11 stages and BOTH need the same
DSL change — a predicate that can read the ACCUMULATED response, i.e. `ReqPred` widened
from `Ctx → Bool` to `Ctx → Response → Bool` (or a `condA` constructor branching on the
accumulator). That is one keystone change unlocking 11 stages by the shape theorems
already proven here. It is a change to `StageProg.lean` + `compile2` (the compiled guard
would read the live slots instead of a pre-decided local), out of this module's scope.

NOT a blocker: the `natToDec` Div/Mod residual. It sits under `serialize`, which this
module does not touch — the composition is proven at the fold/skeleton level
(`denote` / `CoreEnc`), where it does not arise. -/
