# DN.Dataplane.Io.CompletionHandler — the inline completion-handler drain, verified

There are two ways to hand a batch of modeled terminal one-shot completions to a consumer. The
**buffered** way materializes every completion into an array first — a
`List (Completion α ρ)` — and only then walks that array applying the consumer.
The **inline** way never builds the array at all: it *folds* the consumer over
the completions as they are drained, one at a time, applying the consumer to
each completion at the moment it is produced and letting the intermediate
storage evaporate. This file models the inline drain and proves it is
observationally the buffered drain for that one-shot transition system. That no
intermediate list exists is how the model is written, not a proven statement
about memory. It does not model non-final multishot
events, cancellation races, or kernel queue ownership.

The inline consumer is richer than a passive observer: during the callback for a
completion it may **re-submit** new I/O — issue a fresh operation straight back
into the pending slab — instead of parking a work item in a queue for a later
pass. This is the "re-submit during drain" discipline: the callback is handed a
submitter and the new op is enqueued into the slab immediately, in FIFO order,
with no lost work item.

## The model

`HState α ρ β` is the inline consumer's running state:

* `slab : Slab α` — the pending-operation slab (the reactor's, from `Reactor`);
* `log : List β` — the **observations**, newest first: what the consumer
  recorded for each completion it processed. This is the fold accumulator; there
  is deliberately **no** `List (Completion α ρ)` field — nothing is buffered;
* `submits : List α` — the operations re-submitted during callbacks, oldest
  first (FIFO): the work re-issued into the slab mid-drain.

A completion event is a `(Key × ρ)`: the correlator supplied by the modeled
environment and its result. Each accepted event is terminal because `HState.step`
removes its slab entry. The consumer is two pure callbacks:

* `obs : α → ρ → β` — what to record for a completed operation;
* `resub : α → ρ → Option α` — the op (if any) to re-submit during the callback.

`HState.step` processes **one** completion inline: look the correlator up in the
slab (a stale correlator does nothing — `Slab.remove` rejects it), record
`obs op res` directly into `log`, and if `resub` asks for a new op, insert it
into the slab and append it to `submits`. `HState.drain` is exactly
`evs.foldl HState.step` — a fold, never a collect.

## What is proven (0 sorries)

* `handler_inline_no_buffer` — the inline drain's observation log equals the
  buffered drain's: first materialize every completion into a list
  (`bufCollect`), then consume it. Same observations, and `HState` has no
  completion-list field to materialize. (`drain_is_fold` states literally that
  the drain is a `List.foldl`, not a collect.)
* `handler_resubmit_ordered` — a submit issued during a completion callback is
  enqueued in order: `submits` after the drain is exactly the prior submits
  followed by the re-submitted ops **in the order their callbacks fired**
  (`pendingSubmits`, which recomputes the same deltas). None dropped, none
  reordered; that they are later executed is not part of this model. The single-step
  `step_resubmit_live` shows the re-submitted op is retrievable from the slab
  the instant it is enqueued — no lost work item.
* `handler_refines_reactor` — the inline drain observably equals this model's
  one-shot reactor complete-then-consume path: for an observer consumer, the inline log is
  exactly the map of `obs` over the completions the reactor's `RState.complete`
  emits into `done`. The fast inline path delivers the same observation sequence
  as registering each completion in the reactor and consuming its `done` log.

## Native correspondence boundary

The fold equivalence and re-submit ordering are candidate specifications for a
native terminal-completion drain. No refinement theorem currently connects the
model to `poll_dispatch`, io_uring, or kqueue. Native integration must separately
account for multishot continuation, cancellation/close races, token validation,
and ownership of any buffers referenced by a completion.
