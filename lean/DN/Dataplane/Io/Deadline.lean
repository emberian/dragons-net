# DN.Dataplane.Io.Deadline — the unified deadline min-heap with lazy deletion, verified

A completion reactor must wake *exactly* when the nearest of many pending
deadlines expires: connection idle timeouts, request body deadlines, handshake
and keepalive windows all funnel into a single queue that arms **one** kernel
timer for the earliest deadline and re-arms as deadlines come and go. The
running engines realize this with a `BinaryHeap` keyed by deadline plus a hash
map of the live keys; every safety property there lives in a property test.
Here it is a **theorem**.

## The model

A `DQ K` (deadline queue over correlator/connection keys `K`) holds three parts:

* `heap` — the min-heap, modeled by its *ordered projection*: the exact sequence
  a real binary min-heap yields on repeated pop, i.e. entries in nondecreasing
  deadline order. `Sorted` names that invariant, and `insert` preserves it
  (`insert_sorted`), so every reachable state satisfies it.
* `live` — the authoritative map from key to its **current** deadline. A heap
  entry `⟨d, k⟩` is *live* iff `live` still maps `k` to that exact `d`
  (`Live`); otherwise it is a **tombstone** (the key was removed, or its
  deadline was updated and this entry is the stale copy).
* `armed` — the single deadline the kernel timer is currently set for (`Option`:
  at most one armed timer, ever).

**Lazy deletion** is the point: `remove k` drops `k` from `live` and *leaves the
heap untouched* — no O(n) heap surgery. The stale entry is skipped when it
surfaces on pop. `insert`/`update` push a new entry and re-point `live`; the
superseded entry becomes a tombstone the same way.

## What is proven (0 sorries)

* `heap_min_correct` — **peek returns the earliest deadline**: the first live
  entry in the ordered heap has a deadline ≤ every live entry's, and is itself
  live. The queue's notion of "nearest" is the true minimum over live deadlines.
* `heap_lazy_delete` — **a cancelled timer is skipped on pop, not eagerly
  removed**: after `remove k` the heap is byte-for-byte unchanged, yet `k` is
  never emitted by a drain — its entry is passed over as a tombstone.
* `heap_arm_one` — **only the nearest deadline arms the kernel timer**: the
  deadline `arm` selects is a live deadline and is ≤ every live deadline; a queue
  carries at most one armed timer.
* `heap_pop_ordered` — **deadlines fire in order**: the sequence a drain emits is
  itself sorted by deadline (nondecreasing) — no timer fires before an earlier
  one.

## Composition with the reactor

The keys are the reactor's correlators (`DN.Dataplane.Io.Key`) or connection handles: the
armed deadline is the timeout the reactor's `wake`/`complete` loop blocks on, and
a fired key drives a `complete` (idle-close, body-timeout) on the slab. The
lazy-tombstone discipline mirrors the slab's generation tags — a superseded
deadline is skipped exactly as a recycled correlator is rejected in
`DN.Dataplane.Io.Slab`. This is the SPEC the running heap-plus-map queue refines.
