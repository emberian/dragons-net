# DN.Dataplane.Io.Reactor — the completion-queue reactor as a verified transition system

A completion reactor is the beating heart of a multiplatform I/O engine: the
client *submits* operations, the kernel later *completes* them (echoing back the
correlator the client chose), and the reactor maps each completion to the
operation it finishes and hands the result on. The running engines realize this
over io_uring, kqueue, epoll, and IOCP; every safety property there lives in a
`// SAFETY` comment, a fuzz target, or a loom test. Here it is a **theorem**.

## The model

`RState` is the reactor state: a `Slab` of in-flight operations (keyed by the
generation-tagged correlator of `DN.Dataplane.Io.Slab`) and a `done` list — the emitted
completions, newest first. The transitions are ordinary functions (the reactor
is deterministic given the kernel's completion events; the *demonic* freedom —
which completions arrive, in which order, with stale correlators — is exactly the
`Action` sequence the environment supplies):

* `submit op` — register `op` in the slab, returning a fresh correlator key;
* `complete k res` — look the key up; on a **live** slot remove it and emit one
  completion, on a **stale** slot (recycled: generation mismatch) emit nothing;
* `inline op res` — the fast path: an op that completed immediately (e.g. a
  non-blocking send that succeeded) never enters the slab; its completion is
  emitted directly under the reserved wakeup-sentinel key;
* `wake` — the reactor wakeup; it touches no completion state.

## What is proven (0 sorries)

* `submit_live` — a submitted op is live under the correlator `submit` returns;
* `complete_emits_one` — completing a live key emits **exactly one** completion,
  carrying that op and result (no lost completion);
* `completion_needs_live_slot` — a completion is emitted **only** for a live
  (non-stale) slot;
* `no_double_completion` — a second completion on the same key emits nothing:
  each submitted op that completes yields **exactly one** completion;
* `submit_complete_exactly_one` — the headline conservation over a submit/
  complete trace: the pair emits one completion `⟨k, op, res⟩` and re-delivery
  of `k` emits none;
* `inline_eq_deferred` — **inline ≡ deferred**: an op done inline delivers the
  same `(op, result)` completion as register-then-complete (the fast path is
  observationally the slow path).

## Composition with the buffer lease

The slab lifecycle *is* a lease: `submit` = acquire, `complete` = recycle.
`no_double_completion` is `Slab.slab_no_double_remove` lifted to the reactor,
which is itself the slab-level reading of `DN.Dataplane.Ring.recycle_at_most_once` — the
proven recycle-exactly-once discipline under demonic interleaving. The reactor
inherits that discipline: no in-flight op is ever completed twice.

## Model-refines-Rust

This is the SPEC; the running Rust reactors are its realization. The
match-on-completion correlator lookup, the reject-stale branch, the single
completion push, and the inline fast path are the executable form of `complete`,
`Slab.get`, and `inline` here — exactly as `bufring.rs` realizes
`DN.Dataplane.Ring.RecycleOnce`. The Rust remains the running form; this model is the
specification it refines.
