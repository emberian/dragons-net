# DN.Dataplane.Io.Slab — the generation-tagged pending-operation slab, verified

This file models the generation-tagged lookup used by a completion reactor. The
danger is **ABA**: a slot freed and reused between submit and completion would
let a stale key for the previous occupant select the new operation. The model
proves rejection after an unbounded-`Nat` generation increment. Encoding such a
key into a native completion word requires additional index, generation, and
token-namespace bounds; `DN.Dataplane.Io.TokenBridge` supplies that checked
seam.

## The model

A `Slab` is a list of `Slot`s; each slot carries a `gen` (generation counter)
and an optional `payload`. A `Key` is the reactor's correlator — an `(idx, gen)`
pair. `Key.pack` and `Key.unpack` define an arithmetic high-half/low-half
encoding over `Nat`. `Key.unpack_pack` proves its arithmetic round trip when the
index fits below `2^32`; by itself it does not prove that the packed value fits
in 64 bits or is disjoint from the other completion-token namespaces.

Operations:

* `insert v` — take the lowest free slot at index ≥ 1 (or grow by one), store
  `v`, and return a key tagged with that slot's current generation;
* `get k` / `remove k` — look up / take the payload, but **only if the slot's
  generation matches the key's**. `remove` bumps the generation, so every key
  minted before the removal is thereafter stale.

Index 0 is reserved (never allocated): the kernel's wakeup sentinel uses
correlator 0, so a real operation must never receive key index 0.

## What is proven (0 sorries)

* `slab_insert_get` — a fresh insert is retrievable under its returned key;
* `slab_remove_bumps_gen` — removal increments the slot generation;
* `slab_stale_key_none` — **ABA safety**: a `get` whose key generation does not
  match the slot returns `none`. A completion that references a recycled slot
  cannot be accepted;
* `slab_recycled_key_rejected` — the same key, applied to the slab *after* its
  slot was removed (recycled), is rejected;
* `slab_no_double_remove` — a key removes at most once (the slab-level analogue
  of `DN.Dataplane.Ring.recycle_at_most_once`);
* `slab_insert_idx_ne_zero` / `slab_index0_reserved` — the wakeup-sentinel index
  0 is never allocated and never names a live operation.

## Native correspondence boundary

The stale-key and single-remove theorems are candidate specifications for a
native slot table, but no refinement theorem currently connects this model to
the Rust implementation. The active runtime also has finite machine fields and
an exhaustion policy absent from this unbounded model. A native caller must use
the checked token bridge rather than treating every `Key.pack` value as a valid
`u64` correlator.
