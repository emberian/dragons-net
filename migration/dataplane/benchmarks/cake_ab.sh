# A/B: compiled machine-code serve vs the leanc-compiled serve, SAME binary,
# SAME route (GET /), SAME box, SAME load. Toggled by DRORB_CAKE_SERVE.
#
#   (a) leanc serve  : DRORB_CAKE_SERVE unset  -> the deployed leanc pipeline
#   (b) cake serve   : DRORB_CAKE_SERVE=1      -> the compiled export-function
#                      machine code answers GET / in-process
#
# HONEST FRAMING (read before trusting a number):
#  * Loopback lies for ABSOLUTE req/s. Only the RATIO (cake/leanc) and the
#    allocation deltas are reported, never a headline req/s.
#  * The two paths are NOT byte-identical on GET /: the leanc pipeline has no
#    "/" route so it returns a full-header 404; the compiled path returns a
#    308 redirect. So the req/s ratio reflects BOTH the serve-machinery delta
#    AND a response-shape difference (leanc writes ~13 headers, cake ~3). It is
#    a directional "not slower" check, not a clean isolate. The robust,
#    load-independent signal is the STATIC allocation contrast printed at the end.
#  * Single route, single owner thread, 9/14 fused stages. See residuals.
