# lakefiles cannot compile a C source as a build target, so this runs as a
# prerequisite step. Idempotent; re-run after editing cgi_exec.c, then rebuild
# the linking exe (e.g. `lake build orb`).
#
# The shim is plain POSIX (fork/execve/pipe/waitpid) — no external backend. It
# compiles against the active Lean toolchain's runtime header (<lean/lean.h>)
# so the object matches the runtime ABI, while still finding the system SDK
# headers (which the bundled leanc clang does not locate).
