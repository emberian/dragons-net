# `lake build Dataplane:static` compiles the `@[export drorb_serve]` module and
# its transitive dependencies to Mach-O objects under .lake/build/ir/**/*.c.o.export.
# This script archives ALL of those objects into a single static library. The
# host linker pulls only the objects reachable from the symbols it references
# (drorb_serve, initialize_Dataplane and their closure) — the same object set the
# `orb-mac` exe links — so unreferenced modules (including the crypto seam, which
# the deployStepIngress path does not touch) are never pulled in.

# Re-run after changing Dataplane.lean or any module in its closure, then rebuild
# the Rust dataplane (crates/dataplane). Idempotent.

# default `drorb_serve_pipeline_conformant`, and the config-driven
# `drorb_serve_metered_cfg_conformant` (the seam the running default crosses). These
# ride this target's `.c.o.export`; no explicit per-symbol line is needed for them.
lake build Dataplane:static

# `Dataplane:static` compiles only the Dataplane lib's own modules
# (Dataplane, Dataplane.Multi) to objects; a transitive import contributes its
# `.olean` but not its `.c.o.export` object unless some `:static` target owns it.
# `Reactor.ProxyDial` (the `drorb_proxy_pick` reverse-proxy pick seam) is imported
# by Dataplane but lives in the `Reactor` lib, so compile its export object
# explicitly here — otherwise `drorb_proxy_pick` / `initialize_Reactor_ProxyDial`
# are absent from the archive and the host link fails undefined.
# CLOSURE-COMPLETE export build (the robust fix). The `:c.o.export` facet is
# per-module and NOT transitive, and a bare `lake build` does not emit it — so a
# hand-listed set of roots silently drifts out of date whenever Dataplane's import
# closure grows (a new braided stage, a new effect module). That gap stayed hidden
# for a long time because export objects ACCUMULATE in `.lake/build/ir` across
# incremental builds; only a true from-scratch `rm -rf .lake/build` exposes it
# (which is exactly what the CI honest-gate does). Fix: compute Dataplane's full
# transitive import closure and build every module's export facet. No hand-list to
# rot. Lib-only names (no module facet) fail harmlessly and are skipped.
# The closure list itself lives in scripts/dataplane-closure.py — ONE definition,
# so scripts/archive-freshness.sh (which must know exactly which sources the
# archive is cut from) reads the same list rather than a copy that would rot the
# first time a seam is added. Output is byte-identical to the heredoc it replaced
# (verified by diff at the time of the move).
