//! Dataplane-side HTTP response cache: the untrusted STORE for the proven
//! core's cacheability decision.
//!
//! The proven serve is a stateless `ByteArray -> ByteArray` transform: it
//! cannot carry a store across calls (`Reactor.Stage.Cache.serveCached` proves
//! the fresh-hit/miss/coalesce semantics over an `RStore`, but the *store* is
//! state the seam has nowhere to keep). So the store lives HERE, on the
//! untrusted host side, and is keyed by the proven core's decision — exactly the
//! sans-IO split the `Cache` library documents: the proven core decides
//! *cacheability, key, and freshness*; the shell only *stores and replays* bytes
//! it was told it may.
//!
//! ## What the proven core decides (this shell does not)
//!
//! * **Key** — method + request-target, the §4.1 exact-key match
//!   (`Cache.Key`/`rkeyOf` reduce to method + target; the deployed serve varies
//!   only on those two here).
//! * **Cacheability + freshness lifetime** — the response carries the directive
//!   the proven core resolved per RFC 9111 §4.2.1 (`Cache.selectLifetime`:
//!   `s-maxage`/`max-age`/`Expires−Date`). This shell reads `Cache-Control:
//!   max-age=N` off the proven response bytes and stores under that lifetime. It
//!   invents no TTL of its own: a response with no such directive is never
//!   stored, so a route is cacheable iff the proven serve says so.
//! * **Fresh-hit replay** — a stored entry is served without re-running the
//!   handler while `current_age < freshness_lifetime` (§4.2), with the age
//!   arithmetic (`current_age = now − stored_at`) the shell measures against the
//!   proven lifetime. `Cache.cache_hit_fresh` is the property this realizes.
//!
//! ## What this shell does (the effect the proven model abstracts)
//!
//! * Holds one process-global map `(method, target) -> (bytes, stored_at,
//!   max_age)` across serve calls.
//! * Stamps `X-Cache: HIT` + `Age: <seconds>` on a replayed response (the
//!   observable a client — and the conformance driver — reads).
//! * **Coalesces** concurrent same-key misses: the first miss is the *leader*
//!   and runs the handler once; every concurrent miss for the same key is a
//!   *waiter* that blocks on the leader's single fetch and is served from it —
//!   K concurrent misses ⇒ ONE handler run, the §4 request-collapsing the
//!   `Cache.coalesce_single_fetch` theorem proves (`locks`/`pending`).
//!
//! The stored value is the genuine proven-serve output, so a replay never
//! diverges from what the handler + response transforms would have produced —
//! the "no mirror" property `serveCached_second_hits` states.
