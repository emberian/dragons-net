//! HTTP/1.1 framing. The host reads only what it needs to delimit messages on
//! the byte stream (where a request ends, where the next begins) and to decide
//! whether the connection stays open. It parses no request semantics and
//! rewrites nothing — the meaning of every request is the proven core's job.
//!
//! **The framing decision itself is the proven core's job too.** [`next_request`]
//! does not compute the request boundary: it crosses `drorb_frame_request`
//! (`Body.FrameRaw.frameRequestExport`, the C-ABI wrapper of the proven
//! `Body.FrameRaw.frameRaw`) with the raw accumulation buffer and acts on the
//! encoded verdict. Where each request ends — and the smuggling rejection when
//! the framing is ambiguous (CL.TE / TE.CL overlap, duplicate/invalid
//! `Content-Length`, malformed chunk) — is therefore governed by the
//! machine-checked decision (`frameRaw_no_smuggle_general`, `frameRaw_faithful`,
//! `frameRaw_bounded`), not by a host reimplementation that could drift from it.
//! The host retains only what is not a framing decision: the [`REQUEST_CAP`]
//! resource limit (a DoS bound) and the h2c binary-preface fork (HTTP/2 frames,
//! not CRLF-delimited messages).
//!
//! The crossing runs on the calling IO thread, registered once with
//! `lean_initialize_thread` — the same discipline as the attached serve owners
//! (see `serve.rs::spawn_attached_owner` and the multi-owner runtime-safety
//! analysis): the export is a pure `ByteArray -> ByteArray`, every per-call
//! object is created, consumed, and dropped on the one calling thread, and the
//! only cross-thread objects are the module's persistent globals. No thread hop,
//! no job channel — the framing verdict is a direct call.
//!
//! The framing is IO-agnostic: [`next_request`] inspects an accumulation buffer
//! and reports whether a complete request is present, without knowing how the
//! bytes arrived. Both the blocking thread-per-connection loop and the io_uring
//! loop drive it — one by filling the buffer with blocking reads, the other by
//! appending io_uring recv completions. The IO hosts start only after the serve
//! gateway's boot handshake, so the process-global Lean runtime is always up
//! before the first framing scan.
