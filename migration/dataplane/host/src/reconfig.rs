//! Runtime reconfiguration on SIGHUP — the untrusted shell that EXECUTES the
//! proven graceful-drain DECISION when the operator config changes.
//!
//! On `SIGHUP` the host re-reads `DRORB_CONFIG`, re-parses it through the proven
//! parser (`config::reload` → `drorb_deployment_of_config`), and — only if it
//! parses — atomically swaps in the new deployment for every subsequent request.
//! A parse failure keeps the running config (fail-safe). No connection is
//! dropped: a request already in flight holds its own `Arc` snapshot of the old
//! deployment (`config::get`) and finishes under it; the next request picks up
//! the new one.
//!
//! ## Correspondence to the proven `Drain` (`Drain.step` / `DrainContract`)
//!
//! The proven model in `Drain.Basic` / `DrainCorrect` is a lifecycle transition
//! system whose `Drain.step` decides, per event, whether a new connection is
//! ADMITTED and when the old lifecycle has DRAINED. `DrainCorrect.drain_refines_spec`
//! proves `Drain.step` (as `DrainImpl`) satisfies `DrainContract`:
//!
//!   * `noAdmitAfterSignal` — once the drain signal has fired, no `acceptReq` is
//!     `admitted`;
//!   * `neverDrainedWithWork` — the `drained` terminal is never observed while
//!     the in-flight count is positive;
//!   * `drainCompletes` — a lifecycle in the drain window whose in-flight count
//!     has reached zero HAS drained (progress).
//!
//! This module is the untrusted shell that carries out that decision for a
//! config generation. Treat each generation of the deployment as one `Drain`
//! lifecycle. A SIGHUP that installs generation `g+1` is the `beginDrain` event
//! for generation `g`:
//!
//!   * `beginDrain` / `noAdmitAfterSignal`: after the swap, NO new request is
//!     served under the old config — the `RwLock` publish means every subsequent
//!     `config::get` returns generation `g+1`. New work is admitted only under
//!     the new generation, exactly as `Drain.step` refuses every `acceptReq`
//!     after the signal.
//!   * `live` / in-flight: the number of requests still holding an `Arc` to
//!     generation `g` is that lifecycle's `inflight`. The `Arc` refcount is the
//!     concrete `live` witness — the old deployment object stays alive precisely
//!     while a straggler references it.
//!   * `neverDrainedWithWork` + `drainCompletes`: generation `g` is `drained`
//!     exactly when its last in-flight request completes and drops the last
//!     `Arc` (the object is freed) — never earlier (no request is cut off
//!     mid-flight) and always once the last finishes (progress). That is the
//!     `drained ⇔ inflight = 0` biconditional (`drainImpl_drained_iff_idle`).
//!
//! We do not re-derive those facts here — they are proved in `DrainCorrect`. The
//! shell only performs the `beginDrain` swap and lets the language runtime's
//! refcount drain the old generation; the DECISION (admit only under the new
//! generation, never drop an in-flight request) is the proven one.
