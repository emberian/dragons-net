//! The HTTPS front door: a TLS 1.3 listener that terminates real TLS in-process
//! over the VERIFIED server handshake + record layer, then serves each decrypted
//! request through the same proven core the plaintext path runs.
//!
//! This module owns only the socket lifecycle for the TLS port: accept a TCP
//! connection, hand its raw fd to the runtime-owner thread's `drorb_tls_serve`
//! seam (`serve::ServeGateway::serve_tls`), and let the verified TLS 1.3 server
//! run the whole connection in-process — the RFC 8446 handshake
//! (`TlsHandshake.serverStep`: ClientHello parse, X25519 ECDHE, key schedule,
//! Certificate/CertificateVerify/Finished flight, client-Finished check), then
//! the established record layer (`TlsHandshake.appStep`) which opens each
//! application_data record, crosses the proven `drorb_serve` on the decrypted
//! request, and seals the response. Nothing in this file parses a TLS record or
//! touches a key; the proven Lean core does, over verified HACL*/EverCrypt.
//!
//! The plaintext listener is untouched: this is an ADDITIONAL listener, bound
//! only when `DRORB_TLS_LISTEN` is set. The certificate material is a POOL: an
//! Ed25519 default end-entity certificate (DER) plus its 32-byte RFC 8032 signing
//! seed, and — when the operator supplies it — an ECDSA-P256 leaf and an
//! RSA-PSS-2048 leaf. The verified handshake presents the one the proven
//! `chooseCert` selects from the pool per the client's `signature_algorithms`, so
//! a real client that rejects Ed25519 (curl/LibreSSL/browsers) is served an
//! ECDSA-P256 or RSA-PSS certificate and connects. All material loads once at
//! boot from the `DRORB_TLS_*` environment (see [`load_cert`]), defaulting to the
//! self-signed material under `conformance/tls/`.
//!
//! The verified handshake additionally negotiates **ALPN** (`h2` then
//! `http/1.1`): when the client selects `h2` the decrypted record stream drives
//! the proven HTTP/2 connection engine, otherwise the HTTP/1.1 serve — both
//! Lean-side, this file is protocol-agnostic. It also issues
//! **session-resumption** tickets, and does **SNI**-based cert selection and
//! **0-RTT** — all over the same proven `serverStep`. Two of those read the
//! environment Lean-side (not through this cert ABI): `DRORB_TLS_ECDSA_SNI` /
//! `DRORB_TLS_RSA_SNI` bind a pool entry to a host name, and
//! `DRORB_TLS_EARLY_DIR` opts into 0-RTT with a single-use anti-replay register
//! at that path (unset ⇒ resumption only). See `deploy/README.md`.

// --- the host observation seam --------------------------------------------- //

/// The host side of the `drorb_tls_obs_*` seam: what the verified TLS connection
/// reports about itself, turned into the SAME metrics, OTel spans and access-log
/// lines the plaintext reactors emit.
///
/// ## Why this module exists
///
/// `blocking.rs` / `kqueue.rs` / `uring.rs` observe every request because the
/// host owns their loop: it holds the request bytes, gets the response bytes
/// back from the proven serve, and times the round trip. The HTTPS front door is
/// built the other way round — [`run`] hands the whole connection to the verified
/// server and the decrypted traffic never returns to the host — so none of that
/// instrumentation could fire, and HTTPS traffic was un-metered, un-traced and
/// un-logged. That is a poor property for a gateway whose front door is HTTPS.
///
/// The proven side now REPORTS what it did (see the `drorb_tls_obs_*` seam in
/// `Dataplane.lean`) and this module records it. The recording is untrusted-shell
/// work in exactly the sense the other three modules are: it reads bytes that are
/// already decided, renders text, and returns nothing the proven code consults.
///
/// ## What it adds over the plaintext instrumentation
///
/// Everything the plaintext path reports, plus the facts that only exist on a TLS
/// connection and that an operator of a PQ-capable gateway actually needs: the
/// negotiated group (and so whether the post-quantum hybrid was used), the cipher
/// suite, the ALPN protocol, and the SNI host — the last read by the PROVEN
/// ClientHello parser, not re-parsed here.
///
/// ## h2-over-TLS requests ARE now itemised (from inside the proof)
///
/// When ALPN selects `h2` the connection is driven by the proven HTTP/2 engine,
/// and its requests/responses live inside HPACK-encoded frames. Decoding those
/// in the host would duplicate — in untrusted Rust — the parsing the proven
/// engine already does correctly, the exact inversion this codebase avoids. So
/// the fix was made in the proof-carrying component: the engine records each
/// dispatched request/response on its own state (`H2.Conn.ReqObs`) and REPORTS
/// it through `drorb_h2_obs_req` (see [`drorb_h2_obs_req`]), which renders the
/// SAME metric / span / access-log line the HTTP/1.1 tls seam does — with no
/// host-side HPACK. `drorb_tls_connections_total{alpn="h2"}` still counts h2
/// connections; now the requests on them are itemised too.
///
/// Requests served from ACCEPTED 0-RTT early data on the h2 path are reported by
/// the same hook (`enterApp` reports its first-burst dispatch). One residual: the
/// h2 path has no per-request BEGIN, so a reported request's latency is measured
/// from the connection clock rather than that single request's service.
///
/// Requests served from ACCEPTED 0-RTT early data are likewise not itemised; 0-RTT
/// is opt-in (`DRORB_TLS_EARLY_DIR`) and off by default.
///
/// ## Lifetime and boundedness
///
/// State is keyed by file descriptor. [`accepted`] installs a fresh entry the
/// moment a connection is accepted, which is also what clears whatever the
/// PREVIOUS connection on that (reused) descriptor left behind — so a stale entry
/// can never be read, and the map is bounded by the process descriptor table
/// rather than growing with connections served.

// reactors (blocking/uring/kqueue) dispatch could not fire, and a `/static/*`
// request returned `404` over TLS while returning the file on plaintext.
//
// This seam closes that gap. The verified record layer, on a request the proven
// serve answered with a `404`, hands the decrypted request bytes back here; for a
// request under the configured static prefix this crosses the SAME proven
// `drorb_static_resolve` / `drorb_static_decide` decisions the plaintext lane
// crosses and returns the served response bytes (`head ++ body`), which the Lean
// side seals through the record layer. EMPTY means "not a static-lane hit" — the
// proven `404` stands.
//
// Called ONLY from the runtime-owner serve thread, from inside `drorb_tls_serve`
// (the record layer's per-request step). It therefore invokes the proven
