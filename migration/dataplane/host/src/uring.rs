//! The high-performance Linux IO path: an io_uring accept/recv/send event loop.
//!
//! This is the preferred IO path on Linux. It replaces the thread-per-connection
//! blocking model with a small number of **shards** — one event-loop thread per
//! core — each driving its own `io_uring` instance over its own connection set.
//! Accept, receive and send are submitted as SQEs and reaped as CQEs in batches;
//! a shard thread never blocks on a single connection, so one thread services
//! thousands of connections. This is the share-nothing reactor model: no
//! connection state, buffer, or slab is shared between shards.
//!
//! ## The one shared resource, and where the ceiling is
//!
//! The proven core is a pure `ByteArray -> ByteArray` transform, so shards need
//! no shared mutable engine state to run it — but the Lean runtime is a
//! process-global singleton, so there is exactly one runtime-owner thread (see
//! `serve`). Every shard hands its completed requests to that one thread over
//! the gateway channel and is woken with the response through its own eventfd.
//! The IO fabric (accept/recv/send, framing) scales across all shard cores; the
//! serve transform does not. The steady-state throughput ceiling is therefore
//! `1 / (serve latency)` regardless of shard count: the single runtime owner is
//! the bottleneck, and adding shards past the point that keeps the owner busy
//! only adds scheduling contention, not throughput.
//!
//! ## Copy discipline — two modes
//!
//! The **default** loop uses ordinary pooled receive buffers and a copied response:
//! recv into an accumulation `Vec`, copy the framed request into an owned buffer
//! (copy #1), and after the serve crossing copy the proven response bytes into a
//! pooled send buffer (copy #5).
//!
//! The **zero-copy mode** (`zc`, opt-in via `DRORB_ZC=1`) removes both
//! shell-owned full-payload copies, realizing in the running bytes what the
//! `Datapath` and `Uring` Lean theories prove:
//!
//! * **Receive** goes through a provided-buffer ring ([`crate::bufring`]). The
//!   kernel places the datagram into a ring slot and *lends* the slot to the
//!   completion. When a whole request arrives in one slot with nothing pipelined
//!   behind it, the shard hands the serve thread a **borrowed view** of the slot
//!   (`serve::BorrowedReq`) — no owned request copy (copy #1 removed) — and holds
//!   the buffer id *leased* across the serve. The id is *recycled exactly once*,
//!   when the response returns. This is the running counterpart of the proven
//!   `Uring` model: the kernel's `deliver`, the shard's `held` lease, and the
//!   `recycle` back into the ring are the model's edges, and the "each lent id is
//!   recycled at most once per lease" discipline is exactly
//!   `Uring.recycle_at_most_once` (`Uring/RecycleOnce.lean`). The borrowed view is
//!   the running form of `Datapath/Span.lean`'s `SpanBytes` (a request named by an
//!   `(off, len)` window, not copied to be named). Requests that span slots or
//!   arrive pipelined fall back to the accumulation buffer (copy #1 retained for
//!   those) and recycle their slot immediately.
//!
//! * **Send** uses `IORING_OP_SEND_ZC` straight from the proven response's pooled
//!   bytes (copy #5 removed — no userspace copy into the kernel's send path). The
//!   response buffer is held until the kernel posts the zero-copy notification
//!   (`F_NOTIF`) that the send buffer is free, then released. This realizes the
//!   in-place write `Datapath/Serve.lean` proves (`writeInPlace` /
//!   `writeInPlace_faithful`): the finalized response bytes are put on the wire
//!   from the buffer they were built in, without an intervening copy.
//!
//! Copies #2–#4 (the owned-`ByteArray` FFI marshalling and the internal
//! `List UInt8` representation) are *above* the FFI and cannot be removed from the
//! shell; only #1 and #5 are shell-owned. Zero-copy mode keeps the serve output
//! byte-identical — it removes copies, never a byte.
