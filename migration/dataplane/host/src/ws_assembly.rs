//! Bounded, streaming WebSocket message engine (RFC 6455 §5.4–§5.6, §7, §8.1).
//!
//! One [`WsEngine`] lives for the WHOLE connection — decoder state persists
//! across recvs, so frames and messages may straddle any number of socket
//! reads. Its memory ceiling is fixed by construction:
//!
//!   - a 14-byte header accumulator ([`crate::ws::HeaderDecoder`]),
//!   - a 125-byte control-frame buffer (§5.5 caps control payloads at 125),
//!   - ONE message reassembly buffer hard-capped at [`MAX_MESSAGE`] — a data
//!     frame whose declared length would push the message over the cap is
//!     refused with close 1009 BEFORE any of its payload is buffered,
//!
//! and `feed` is a flat loop (no recursion anywhere), so no input schedule can
//! grow host state or the call stack. This module keeps only the BUFFERING;
//! every decision is the proven core's, crossed per event:
//!
//!   - §5.1 client masking, §5.2 RSV=0 / defined opcodes / 63-bit length,
//!     §5.5 control shape — at header time, by the proven header verdict
//!     (`Ws.Decode.decodeHeader` via the [`crate::ws`] decoder);
//!   - §5.4 fragmentation discipline + the reassembly bound — at header time,
//!     by the proven admission verdict (`Ws.ReassemblyAdmit.admit` via
//!     `drorb_ws_admit`): a continuation needs an open message, a new data
//!     opcode may not preempt one, control frames may interleave, and the cap
//!     refusal (1009) lands before buffering — proven to agree with the
//!     `Ws.Reassembly.step` fragmentation FSM exactly;
//!   - §5.6/§8.1 text messages are valid UTF-8, validated INCREMENTALLY by
//!     the proven automaton (`Ws.Utf8.run` via `drorb_ws_utf8`): the host
//!     holds one watermark-state word, a character may straddle fragment or
//!     recv boundaries, a definite violation fails fast (close 1007) — proven
//!     equivalent to the whole-string RFC 3629 spec on every chunk schedule;
//!   - §5.5.1/§7 close frames: 2-byte code, registry-valid code, UTF-8
//!     reason, and the handshake reply (echo the peer's code) — by the proven
//!     close-body verdict (`Ws.ReassemblyClose.closeBody` via
//!     `drorb_ws_close_body`); a protocol failure sends the matching code
//!     before the connection drops.
//!
//! Complete data messages are echoed back as one unfragmented server frame;
//! pings are answered with payload-echoing pongs (§5.5.2/§5.5.3).
//!
//! ## RFC 7692 permessage-deflate
//!
//! When the handshake negotiated permessage-deflate ([`crate::ws::WsConfig`]),
//! a data message whose FIRST frame carries RSV1 (the compressed marker peeled
//! by [`crate::ws::HeaderDecoder`]) has a DEFLATE-compressed payload. Such a
//! message is buffered compressed (the reassembly cap and per-frame masking are
//! unchanged), then, at delivery, its concatenated payload — with the RFC 7692
//! §7.2.2 trailing `00 00 FF FF` re-appended — is inflated; UTF-8 validation of
//! a text message runs on the DECOMPRESSED bytes. Echoes are compressed when
//! the extension is in effect (RSV1 set, the trailing `00 00 FF FF` stripped
//! per §7.2.1). Context takeover — whether the inflate/deflate LZ77 window
//! carries across messages — follows the negotiated `no_context_takeover`
//! parameters. The DEFLATE codec itself is `flate2`/miniz_oxide: a trusted,
//! well-audited data transform, the same principled-TCB posture as the reactor
//! gzip seam (`crate::gzip`) and the crypto FFI — NOT verified. The framing,
//! masking, fragmentation, close, and UTF-8 DECISIONS around it stay the proven
//! core's; only the byte-for-byte compression transform is trusted.
