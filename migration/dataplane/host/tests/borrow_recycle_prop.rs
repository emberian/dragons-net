//! Property tests for the runtime buffer-lease invariants of the provided-buffer
//! ring (`bufring.rs` / the lease bookkeeping in `uring.rs`), plus a runnable
//! check for the model's `nodrop` soundness precondition (gap E).
//!
//! These are the *runtime* analogues of the abstract `Uring/*.lean` laws:
//!
//! - `conservation` (`Uring/Conservation.lean:544`): every buffer id inhabits
//!   exactly one location — here `free` (published in the ring, kernel-owned) or
//!   `held` (leased to a connection). Never both, never neither.
//! - `recycle_at_most_once` (`Uring/RecycleOnce.lean:728`): the deployed
//!   `Conn.leased_bid: Option<u16>` + `Option::take()` (uring.rs:916) makes a
//!   second recycle of a stored lease a structural no-op.
//! - the observability identity `ZC_BORROW - ZC_RECYCLE == live leases`
//!   (uring.rs:100/103) — active leases are conserved.
//!
//! No external test dependency (proptest/quickcheck): a small deterministic PRNG
//! drives thousands of random op sequences, and small buffer-counts are
//! enumerated exhaustively — matching the twin crates' zero-dep test style.
