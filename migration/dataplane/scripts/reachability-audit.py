"""reachability-audit.py — which proofs actually reach the shipped binary.

drorb proves a great deal of Lean and ships one native artifact
(`crates/dataplane/src/main.rs` linked against `libdrorb.a`, cut by
`ffi/build-dataplane-lib.sh`).  Between those two facts sits a gap nobody could
previously measure: a module can be fully proven, build green, and still be
*unreachable* — no `@[export]`, or an `@[export]` no host code calls, or a call
site that only fires behind an environment gate nobody sets.

This script measures that gap mechanically, from source, with no build required.

It answers two questions for the whole tree:

  (a) EXPORT REACHABILITY.  For every `@[export sym]` in Lean: does a host call
      site exist (Rust or the C marshalling shims)?  Is that call site reachable
      from `fn main` of the deployed binary with NO condition on the path
      (DEFAULT-PATH), only under named env-var / CLI / match-arm conditions
      (GATED — the gates are named), or not at all (ORPHANED)?

  (b) MODULE REACHABILITY.  For every Lean module carrying theorems: does it
      contribute an `@[export]`, and is it inside the export-object closure that
      `ffi/build-dataplane-lib.sh` archives into `libdrorb.a`?  A module outside
      that closure is not in the shipped artifact at all, however proven.

METHOD, and its limits (stated so the numbers are not over-read)

  * The host call graph is built by brace-matched parsing of `crates/**/*.rs`
    and `crates/**/ffi/*.c` + `ffi/*.c` with comments stripped (doc comments
    quote export names constantly; leaving them in would fabricate call sites).
    Call resolution is by NAME and is deliberately OVER-approximate: any
    identifier matching a known function name counts as an edge.  Over-
    approximation is the safe direction here — it can only make something look
    MORE reachable, so an ORPHANED verdict is strong evidence, while a
    DEFAULT-PATH verdict is an upper bound on reachability.

  * "DEFAULT-PATH" means: an unconditional path exists from `fn main` to the
    call site.  It does NOT mean "runs on every request" — startup, subcommand
    dispatch and reactor selection all sit on such paths.  The per-request
    subset is reported separately (REQUEST-PATH) by re-running the same
    reachability from the connection handlers of each IO reactor.

  * Gates are extracted syntactically: `env::var("X")` read into a local or a
    helper that a guarding `if`/`match` mentions, `--flag` string literals in a
    guarding condition, and match-arm patterns.  A gate this misses shows up as
    DEFAULT-PATH, so the DEFAULT-PATH bucket is again an upper bound.

  * Lean theorem counts are a `^theorem|^lemma` declaration count, not a
    semantic weight.

Usage:
    scripts/reachability-audit.py [--root DIR] [--json OUT.json]
                                  [--markdown OUT.md] [--quiet]
                                  [--check-orphan-max N]

Exit status is 0 unless --check-orphan-max is given and exceeded (the CI
regression-gate mode: orphan count may not grow).

# INTENTIONAL exports — orphaned by the call graph, on purpose, with a reason
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# An `@[export]` with no host call site is normally a proof that reaches no binary,
# and the CI gate exists to make that cost a conversation. A handful are different:
# the symbol is DELIBERATELY not called, and the reason is a design decision someone
# wrote down. Counting those with the accidental ones inflates the number and, worse,
# creates pressure to DELETE a deliberate affordance to make the gate go green.
#
# So they get their own category, each with a REASON, counted separately from
# unintentional orphans. Three rules keep this from becoming a silencer:
#
#   * an entry is a diff with prose in it — adding one is visible and arguable;
#   * a STALE entry (the symbol got wired, or no longer exists) FAILS the gate, so
#     the list cannot quietly accumulate;
#   * the reason must say why the symbol is not called, not merely that it is not.
#
# Deleting an export to move the number is the thing this category exists to prevent.

    # the closure is how it is actually invoked — the `@[export]` exists so the shell
