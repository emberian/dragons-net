//! The cross-thread
//! borrow↔recycle handoff of the mmap'd provided-buffer slice — the ONE
//! elevated-severity reactor corner the single-threaded `Uring/*.lean` LTS
//! cannot express and no other test covers. A use-after-recycle here is a
//! *cross-connection data disclosure* (the kernel re-lends the recycled slot
//! and overwrites bytes a serve worker is still reading), not a mere leak.
//!
//! Run with:
//! ```text
//! RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test -p dn-borrow-recycle-model --release --test loom -- --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! # What the real handoff is (uring.rs / serve.rs / bufring.rs, drorb)
//!
//! 1. **shard thread**, `on_recv_br` (uring.rs): the kernel delivered
//!    conn A's bytes into buffer `bid`; the shard sets `conn.leased_bid =
//!    Some(bid)` (uring.rs), wraps a raw view `BorrowedReq::new(ptr, len)`
//!    into the mmap'd `bufs` region (`bufring.rs::slice`, :119), and hands it
//!    to the serve worker via `submit_borrowed_metered(borrowed, meter, reply)`
//!    with `reply = ServeReply::Shard(mtx, efd, slot)` (uring.rs).
//! 2. **serve worker thread** (serve.rs): reads the borrowed slice
//!    inside `serve_*_into(job.req.bytes(), …)`, builds the response, then
//!    fires the reply: `mailbox.send(ShardDone { conn, resp })` **then**
//!    `wake(efd)` (serve.rs).
//! 3. **shard thread**, `on_wakeup` (uring.rs): the eventfd Read completion
//!    wakes it; it drains `mrx.try_recv()` and calls `stage_response`
//!    (uring.rs), which does `c.leased_bid.take()` → `br.recycle(bid)` →
//!    `BufRing::add` (bufring.rs): a Release store on the ring tail that
//!    republishes the slot, after which the **kernel may re-lend and overwrite
//!    it**.
//!
//! The safety claim (`uring.rs`, a doc-comment, machine-checked nowhere
//! before this model): *the worker's read of the slice happens-before the
//! shard's recycle*, carried by `worker-read → mailbox.send (Release) →
//! shard try_recv (Acquire) → recycle`. The `wake(efd)`/eventfd Read pair is a
//! strictly stronger syscall barrier layered on top; this model captures only
//! the **weakest link** (the mpsc channel's Release/Acquire), so a green result
//! is conservative.
//!
//! # What THIS loom model covers vs the real deploy (read before trusting)
//!
//! - MODELS: the recycle-direction race only — one lease, one worker, the
//!   completion signal (`done`, Release/Acquire = the mpsc guarantee), the
//!   `leased_bid.take()` recycle-once, and the *strongest adversary* for the
//!   kernel overwrite (it fires immediately on recycle, earlier than any real
//!   kernel re-lend). The delivery direction (kernel wrote the bytes → shard
//!   observed the CQE → handed the borrow to the worker) is taken as already
//!   happens-before-established (the io_uring CQE is a syscall barrier and the
//!   worker is spawned after it), so it is encoded as an ordered write before
//!   the worker starts.
//! - DOES NOT model: the io_uring SQ/CQ rings themselves (see `ring-twin`), the
//!   eventfd coalescing (see `wake-twin`), the plain-recv fallback path
//!   (uring.rs), multishot re-arm (the deploy is one-shot), or the
//!   `bufring.rs` tail Release/Acquire against the *kernel* (that pairing is the
//!   trusted kernel-ABI floor). This is loom evidence for ONE invariant on a
//!   faithful hand-model — NOT a proof that `uring.rs` is verified.
