//! Exhaustive schedule check of the metered rate-gate **pair publication**
//! (`config::set_raw`'s `RATE_LIMIT`/`RATE_WINDOW_MS` stores vs the shard accept
//! gate's `rate_limit()`/`rate_window()` reads — `uring.rs`,
//! `kqueue.rs`).
//!
//! Run with:
//! ```text
//! RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test -p dn-config-publish-model --release --test loom -- --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! # The claim (config.rs, drorb)
//!
//! A SIGHUP reload replaces generation `G0 = (l0, w0)` of the rate-gate pair with
//! `G1 = (l1, w1)`. The proven `429` decision (`rate_limit_fires` /
//! `Reactor.Stage.Rate.resp429`, `Reactor/StandingCounters.lean`) is a function of
//! ONE consistent `(limit, window)`. The running gate refines it only if every
//! read observes a WHOLE generation — `observe() ∈ {G0, G1}`. The deployed
//! `config.rs` publishes the pair as two independent stores and each shard reads
//! it as two independent loads, so a read can interleave BETWEEN the two stores
//! and see a torn cross-product `(l1, w0)` or `(l0, w1)`.
//!
//! # What this suite covers vs the real deploy (read before trusting)
//!
//! - MODELS, over every interleaving of one reconfig publish against one shard
//!   read: (1) [`torn_read_reached`] — the DEPLOYED two-atomic shape (`Relaxed`,
//!   exactly `config.rs`) admits a torn read; loom reaches it, including the
//!   clamp-defeating `(l0, w1)`. (2) [`torn_read_reached_even_seqcst`] — the tear
//!   survives `SeqCst` on both fields, so it is an interleaving fault, not a
//!   memory-ordering one: strengthening the per-field ordering cannot fix it.
//!   (3) [`packed_read_is_always_a_whole_generation`] — the single-`AtomicU64`
//!   fix makes every observation a whole generation, over all schedules.
//! - DOES NOT model: `standing.rs` window aging / the `Instant` clock, the
//!   `max-connections` and `slowloris-timeout` fields (each read ALONE, so no
//!   pair-atomicity requirement; a single consistent 4-tuple would need the
//!   seqlock in the scope note below), the `RwLock<Arc<Deployment>>` serve-config
//!   swap (already all-or-nothing), or the SIGHUP/parse path. This is loom
//!   evidence for the PAIR publication only — not a proof that `config.rs` is
//!   verified.
//!
//! # Scope note — the general fix
//!
//! [`PackedConfig`] fixes the `(limit, window)` PAIR because both fields fit
//! `u32`. If an operator needs joint consistency across all FOUR accept-gate
//! fields (`max_connections`, `rate_limit`, `rate_window`, `slowloris`), or a
//! window wider than `u32::MAX` ms, the pack does not scale; the general answer
//! is a generation seqlock (an even/odd counter with `SeqCst` fences, the reader
//! retrying while the counter is odd or changed) or publishing the whole tuple in
//! one `Arc` the reader clones — the same all-or-nothing discipline the serve
//! config's `RwLock<Arc<Deployment>>` already uses.
