//! Blocking reactor's SHARED per-source **connection-limit gate**
//! (`SharedStanding::admit` / `on_close`, `migration/dataplane/host/src/standing.rs`):
//! the `ConnLimit` check-and-increment must be a SINGLE critical section so
//! concurrent accept/worker threads from one source can never both read
//! `active == cap-1` and both admit — the TOCTOU over-admit that lets a source
//! exceed the configured `max-connections` cap. Plus the accept/close
//! conservation: a concurrent `on_close` frees exactly one slot, and the counter
//! never over- or under-counts.
//!
//! Run with:
//! ```text
//! RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test -p dn-conn-limit-model --release --test loom -- --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! # What the real gate is (standing.rs, drorb)
//!
//! The io_uring / kqueue shards keep their per-source counters in the LOCK-FREE
//! [`Standing`] (`standing.rs`): one `Standing` per shard, touched only by that
//! shard's single event-loop thread. There is NO cross-thread race there — that is
//! precisely why it needs no lock, and why loom has nothing to explore for it
//! (modeling it would be vacuous: a single thread, one interleaving).
//!
//! The `SharedStanding` variant (`standing.rs`) is the concurrent one — the
//! thread-per-connection *blocking* reactor, whose accept loop and per-connection
//! worker threads run at the same time. Its per-source counter is striped under
//! `Mutex<HashMap<IpAddr,u32>>`, and one source's traffic all hashes to one stripe,
//! so two concurrent accepts from that source contend on the SAME lock:
//!
//! 1. **accept thread**, `admit(ip, cap)` (`standing.rs`): takes the stripe
//!    lock ONCE, reads `n = active(ip)`, and — still holding the lock — refuses if
//!    `n >= cap`, else increments and admits. The check and the increment are one
//!    critical section (`standing.rs`).
//! 2. **worker thread**, `on_close(ip)` (`standing.rs`): when the connection's
//!    worker returns, takes the stripe lock, decrements (saturating at zero, drops
//!    the entry at zero).
//!
//! The safety claim (`standing.rs`, doc-comment, machine-checked nowhere
//! before this model): *the single critical section means concurrent accepts from
//! one source cannot both slip past the cap boundary — no TOCTOU over-admit*, so
//! `active(ip)` never exceeds `cap`; and accept/close is conserved
//! (`active = #admitted - #closed`, never negative). This is the run-time
//! counterpart of the `conn_conservation` / `ConnLimit.admits` invariants proven
//! in `Reactor/StandingCounters.lean`. `SharedStanding::rate_note` (`standing.rs`,
//! the `429` gate) rests on the IDENTICAL single-critical-section discipline (one
//! stripe held across age-and-count), so this model witnesses that pattern too.
//!
//! # What THIS loom model covers vs the real deploy (read before trusting)
//!
//! - MODELS, over every interleaving of two concurrent accepts on one source's
//!   stripe (one `u32` behind one `loom::sync::Mutex`, exactly the striped
//!   `active(ip)` slot): (1) NO over-admit — the peak concurrent `active` never
//!   exceeds `cap`, and with `cap==1` exactly one of two racing accepts is admitted;
//!   (2) accept/close conservation — a worker's concurrent `on_close` frees exactly
//!   one slot and the counter returns to zero with no double-count and no underflow.
//! - DOES NOT model: the `HashMap`/striping itself (a source maps to one fixed
//!   stripe — modeled as that one counter — and distinct stripes are independent by
//!   construction), the lock-free shard-path [`Standing`] (single-threaded, nothing
//!   to interleave), the `rate_note` window aging / `Instant` clock, the accept
//!   syscall or the worker's socket I/O, or `on_close`'s saturating-subtract as a
//!   real underflow source (the accept/close discipline calls it once per admitted
//!   conn — this model closes only what it admitted). This is loom evidence for the
//!   check-and-increment ATOMICITY of one striped counter — NOT a proof that
//!   `standing.rs` is verified.
