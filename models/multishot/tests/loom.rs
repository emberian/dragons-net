//! io_uring **multishot-recv re-arm coordination** — a reactor concurrency edge
//! not covered by any existing twin. When a multishot recv posts its terminal
//! CQE (the provided-buffer ring is exhausted, `res == -ENOBUFS`, `F_MORE`
//! cleared), the multishot is OFF and must be re-armed — but only once a buffer
//! is free again, and a buffer becomes free when a serve worker RECYCLES its
//! lease. If that recycle runs on the worker thread, the re-arm decision races
//! the recycle. The invariant: the recv is re-armed EXACTLY ONCE per exhaustion
//! once a buffer is available — never dropped, never double-armed.
//!
//! Run with:
//! ```text
//! RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test -p dn-multishot-model --release --test loom -- --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! # The two edges (what the threads model)
//!
//! 1. **shard thread**, terminal CQE: the kernel drained the last free buffer
//!    and posted `res == -ENOBUFS` with `F_MORE` cleared. In the deployed
//!    one-shot analog this is `on_recv_br`'s ENOBUFS arm (uring.rs) and the
//!    F_MORE terminal test is `on_send_zc`'s `cqueue::more(flags)` (uring.rs).
//!    The shard publishes `armed = OFF`, then RE-CHECKS whether a buffer is free
//!    and, if so, tries to claim the re-arm.
//! 2. **worker thread**, recycle: a serve worker finished with its lease and
//!    republishes the slot into the ring — `BufRing::recycle`/`add` (bufring.rs),
//!    the model's `recycle_bid` (uring.rs) moved onto the worker. It
//!    publishes `free += 1`, then RE-CHECKS whether the multishot is OFF and, if
//!    so, tries to claim the re-arm.
//!
//! The re-arm needs BOTH conditions — `armed == OFF` AND `free > 0` — and each is
//! made true by a DIFFERENT thread. The load-bearing discipline: each thread
//! re-checks the OTHER condition AFTER publishing its own, with a SeqCst FENCE
//! between the publish and the re-check (this is the store-buffering shape — under
//! Release/Acquire, and even under SeqCst atomic operations as loom models them,
//! BOTH re-checks may miss the other's write and neither arms; loom found exactly
//! that lost re-arm twice before the fence, see `try_rearm`), and the transition
//! to ARMED is claimed by a single compare-exchange (so only one thread arms — no
//! double-arm). Drop the fence, the re-check, or the CAS and loom finds the break.
//!
//! # What THIS loom model covers vs the real deploy (read before trusting)
//!
//! - MODELS, over every interleaving of one terminal-CQE and one concurrent
//!   recycle: (1) NO lost re-arm — after both edges settle with a buffer free the
//!   multishot ends ARMED (the receive restarts); (2) NO double-arm — the OFF→ARMED
//!   transition fires exactly once, so there are never two multishot recvs in
//!   flight on one fd (which would double-deliver bytes and double-consume the
//!   ring); (3) buffer conservation — an arm consumes exactly the one recycled
//!   buffer, `free` never underflows.
//! - DOES NOT model: the io_uring SQ/CQ rings themselves (see `ring-twin`), the
//!   eventfd wakeup that carries the poke (see `wake-twin`), the borrow↔recycle
//!   data race the lease itself rides (see `borrow-recycle-twin` / `splitsend-twin`),
//!   more than one outstanding buffer / a ring of depth > 1 (this isolates the
//!   single-buffer exhaustion boundary, the tightest re-arm witness), or the
//!   kernel-side buf_ring tail Release/Acquire (the trusted kernel-ABI floor).
//!   Crucially it does NOT claim the deployed one-shot `uring.rs` contains this
//!   race — the deploy re-arms and recycles on the same shard thread; this is a
//!   PROSPECTIVE-design model. loom evidence for ONE invariant on a faithful
//!   hand-model — NOT a proof that `uring.rs` is verified.

///     is the teeth for this.
///
///  2. **A SeqCst fence between publish and re-check.** This is the classic
///     two-flag rendezvous / store-buffering (SB) shape: the terminal-CQE edge
///     publishes `armed = OFF` and then reads `free`; the recycle edge publishes
///     `free += 1` and then reads `armed`. Those are stores and loads on TWO
