//! The **DEPLOYED one-shot buffer-select recv path** (`migration/dataplane/host/src/uring.rs`):
//! the per-request lease `acquire -> process -> recycle` cycle through the single
//! `Conn.leased_bid` cell. This IS the real deployed path — the recv is one-shot
//! (`recv_br_sqe`, uring.rs, has NO multishot flag), so at most one recv is in
//! flight and at most one lease is held per connection at a time, and the NEXT
//! recv is armed only after the current request's response recycled its lease.
//! The invariant: over that cycle the lease is recycled EXACTLY ONCE, the borrowed
//! slot is not recycled before the serve worker finished reading it (no
//! cross-request disclosure), and every lent buffer id returns to the ring — no
//! cross-request lease leak.
//!
//! Run with:
//! ```text
//! RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test -p dn-oneshot-recv-model --release --test loom -- --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! # What the real one-shot cycle is (uring.rs / serve.rs / bufring.rs, drorb)
//!
//! 1. **shard thread**, `arm_recv` (uring.rs) -> `recv_br_sqe` (uring.rs):
//!    arms ONE buffer-select recv (plain `Recv` + `BUFFER_SELECT`, NO
//!    `IORING_RECV_MULTISHOT`). Exactly one CQE will land for it.
//! 2. **shard thread**, `on_recv_br` (uring.rs): the kernel delivered the
//!    request into provided buffer `bid` (the model's `deliver`). On the borrow
//!    fast path the shard ACQUIRES the lease — `conn.leased_bid = Some(bid)`
//!    (uring.rs) — wraps a raw view of the mmap'd slot (`BorrowedReq::new`,
//!    `bufring.rs::slice`), and hands it to a serve worker via
//!    `submit_borrowed_metered(borrowed, meter, reply)` with
//!    `reply = ServeReply::Shard(mtx, efd, slot)`.
//! 3. **serve worker thread** (serve.rs): reads the borrowed slice
//!    inside `serve_*_into(job.req.bytes(), ...)`, builds the response, then
//!    `mailbox.send(ShardDone { conn, resp })` **then** `wake(efd)`.
//! 4. **shard thread**, `on_wakeup` (uring.rs) -> `stage_response`
//!    (uring.rs) -> `stage_response_appended` (uring.rs): RECYCLES the
//!    lease — `c.leased_bid.take()` -> `br.recycle(bid)` (uring.rs) — then
//!    stages and arms the response send.
//! 5. **shard thread**, `on_send` -> `finish_send` (uring.rs): on keep-alive,
//!    `dispatch_acc` -> `arm_recv` arms the NEXT recv — the next per-request cycle.
//!    The next recv is armed ONLY here, AFTER step 4 recycled: that is the one-shot
//!    serialization that keeps the single `leased_bid` cell holding at most one
//!    live lease.
//!
//! The lease is also recycled-exactly-once on the two OTHER shard-side edges that
//! terminate a cycle: the submit-failed arm (`leased_bid = None` then
//! `recycle_bid`, uring.rs, when the serve thread is gone at shutdown)
//! and `close` (`leased_bid.take()` -> recycle, uring.rs). In the historical
//! reactor all three edges ran on the one shard thread, so they could not race;
//! nothing in the lease itself enforced that, and the single `Option::take()` is
//! what would have to carry the exclusion if a later path reached the hand-back
//! from another thread. The model races two hand-backs to hold the take to it.
//!
//! The safety claim (uring.rs, doc-comments, machine-checked
//! nowhere before this model): *the worker's read of the borrowed slot
//! happens-before the shard's recycle* (carried by `worker-read -> mailbox.send
//! (Release) -> shard try_recv (Acquire) -> recycle`; the `wake(efd)`/eventfd Read
//! is a strictly stronger syscall barrier on top), and *the one-shot single-recv
//! serialization means the single `leased_bid` cell never holds two live leases*,
//! so every lent `bid` is recycled exactly once and none leaks from the ring.
//!
//! # What THIS loom model covers vs the real deploy (read before trusting)
//!
//! - MODELS the per-request one-shot cycle around the single `leased_bid` cell and
//!   the buf_ring slot re-lent for the NEXT request:
//!   (1) NO recycle-before-process — the worker reads its OWN request's bytes,
//!   never the next request's re-lend of the same slot (a cross-request
//!   disclosure), carried by the mailbox Release/Acquire handoff (the weakest
//!   real link; the eventfd syscall is stronger);
//!   (2) recycle-EXACTLY-once — two paths race for the lease and one wins;
//!   (3) buffer CONSERVATION — the lent `bid` returns to the ring (`leased_bid`
//!   ends `None`), so the ring never bleeds buffers.
//!   The LITMUS (`overlapping_recv_leaks_lease`) removes the one-shot serialization
//!   — two concurrent deliveries into the single per-connection lease cell, what an
//!   overlapping / multishot recv would do — and loom finds the interleaving where a
//!   delivery overwrites a still-`Some` cell before its `take`, leaking that `bid`
//!   from the ring (recycles < acquires). This is exactly the hazard the deployed
//!   one-shot design forbids by keeping one recv in flight per connection.
//! - DOES NOT model: the io_uring SQ/CQ rings themselves (see `ring-twin`), the
//!   eventfd coalescing that carries the wake (see `wake-twin`), the plain-recv /
//!   accumulation fallback (uring.rs, which recycles its slot immediately
//!   before any worker touches it — no cross-thread lease there), the prospective
//!   multishot re-arm race (see `multishot-twin` — the deploy is one-shot), or the
//!   `bufring.rs` tail Release/Acquire against the KERNEL (the trusted kernel-ABI
//!   floor). This shares the recycle-direction edge with `borrow-recycle-twin` but
//!   adds the per-request lease-CELL conservation and the cross-request re-lend +
//!   overlap-leak that the single-lease model omits. loom evidence for these
//!   invariants on a faithful hand-model — NOT a proof that `uring.rs` is verified.
