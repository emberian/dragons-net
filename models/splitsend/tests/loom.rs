//! Zero-copy **SplitSend** writev↔recycle handoff (`DRORB_SPAN=15`,
//! `migration/dataplane/host/src/uring.rs`): the borrowed request body is sent to the
//! socket as one `writev` gather straight from the still-held buf_ring lease
//! slot — never copied into an output buffer. The lease slot must stay leased
//! until the writev fully settles; a recycle-while-in-flight lets the kernel
//! re-lend the slot to another connection and overwrite the body bytes the
//! writev is still gathering onto this connection's socket — a cross-connection
//! *data disclosure*, the same class as the gap-F borrow↔recycle corner.
//!
//! Unlike gap-F (a cross-*thread* shard↔serve-worker handoff carried by the
//! serve mailbox), the SplitSend recycle runs on the SHARD thread itself, in
//! `on_split_send`, only after it reaps the writev CQE. The concurrent reader
//! is the KERNEL performing the `writev` gather; the completion signal is the
//! writev CQE — a syscall barrier, strictly stronger than the mailbox
//! Release/Acquire the gap-F model captures.
//!
//! Run with:
//! ```text

//! ```
//!
//! # What the real path is (uring.rs, drorb)
//!
//! 1. **shard thread**, `on_recv_br`: the kernel delivered conn A's request
//!    bytes into buffer `bid`; the shard sets `conn.leased_bid = Some(bid)` and
//!    `conn.req_len = n`, and dispatches the serve WITHOUT recycling the slot
//!    (uring.rs).
//! 2. **serve worker**: computes the response HEAD only (no body append); the
//!    body will be spliced from the held slot.
//! 3. **shard thread**, `stage_split_response` (uring.rs): keeps the lease
//!    HELD (`leased_bid` is read, NOT `take`n — uring.rs), stores
//!    `conn.split = Some(SplitSend { body_bid, body_len, .. })`, and arms a
//!    `writev` (`split_send_sqe`, uring.rs) whose second iovec is
//!    `br.slice(body_bid, body_len)` — a raw pointer into the mmap'd buf_ring
//!    slot (uring.rs). The lease is the writev's body source.
//! 4. **kernel**: the `writev` gathers head ‖ body from the slot onto the
//!    socket. While it is in flight the slot bytes MUST NOT change.
//! 5. **shard thread**, `on_split_send` (uring.rs): the writev CQE wakes
//!    it; `sp.sent += res`. On a SHORT write (`sent < head+body`) it re-arms
//!    (`push_split_send`, uring.rs) — another kernel read of the SAME
//!    still-held slot — and does NOT recycle. Only once the whole response has
//!    settled does it `leased_bid.take()` → `br.recycle(bid)` (uring.rs):
//!    a Release store on the buf_ring tail that republishes the slot, after
//!    which the **kernel may re-lend and overwrite it**.
//!
//! The safety claim (uring.rs / 1092–1093 / 1159, doc-comments,
//! machine-checked nowhere before this model): *the kernel's writev read(s) of
//! the slot happen-before the shard's recycle*, carried by
//! `writev-gather-read → CQE (Release) → shard reap (Acquire) → recycle`, and
//! the recycle happens EXACTLY ONCE even across short-write re-arms
//! (`leased_bid.take()` at the final completion only). This model captures both
//! invariants on the *weakest* ordering that carries them (a Release/Acquire
//! completion count standing in for the CQE syscall barrier), so a green result
//! is conservative.
//!
//! # What THIS loom model covers vs the real deploy (read before trusting)
//!
//! - MODELS: (1) writev-settles-before-recycle — the kernel's gather-read of the
//!   borrowed slot happens-before the recycle, single-segment and across a
//!   short-write re-arm; (2) recycle-once — `leased_bid.take()` yields the lease
//!   exactly once at the FINAL completion, never at a re-arm; and the *strongest
//!   adversary* for the kernel overwrite (the re-lend fires immediately on
//!   recycle, earlier than any real kernel re-lend). The delivery direction
//!   (kernel wrote conn A's request bytes → shard observed the recv CQE → held
//!   the lease) is taken as already happens-before-established (the recv CQE is a
//!   syscall barrier), so it is encoded as an ordered write before the send
//!   begins.
//! - DOES NOT model: the io_uring SQ/CQ rings themselves (see `ring-twin`), the
//!   eventfd coalescing (see `wake-twin`), the cross-thread serve mailbox that
//!   produced the head (see the `borrow-recycle` model), the appended/copying
//!   send fallback (`stage_response_appended`, uring.rs), the `res <= 0`
//!   error close, or the `bufring.rs` tail Release/Acquire against the *kernel*
//!   (that pairing is the trusted kernel-ABI floor). The writev gather is modeled
//!   as a single logical read per segment, not the kernel's byte-by-byte copy.
//!   This is loom evidence for TWO invariants on a faithful hand-model — NOT a
//!   proof that `uring.rs` is verified.
